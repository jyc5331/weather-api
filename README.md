Weather API

This weather app allows the user to access the current and five-day-forecasts for a city of their choice. Searched cities create an index of buttons on the left side of the page that can be clicked to populate the page with the button's city name.

The application can be accessed at: https://jyc5331.github.io/weather-api/

The app was created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and features third party APIs from openweathermap.org
